Thank you for taking part in the Kouo experience at WebSummit. It was a pleasure meeting you and we hope you’ve enjoyed translating your emotions into a piece of art. 

<br><br>

Your unique NeuroPrint is attached.

The modal mood recorded during your session was: [ModalMood]

<br><br>

I would encourage you to share them with others (don’t worry they won’t be able to tell what you were feeling &#128521;). It can be through an online post, an email to your parents or just show it to a friend over a coffee one Sunday. How you do it matters less than the why. More on that below &#128071;

<br><br>

Our aim at Kouo is to help people like you and me redefine our relationships with the world and with ourselves. We do this by developing adaptive tools that connect emotional states to everyday activities, helping users better manage their emotions, habits and relationships with others.

<br><br>

While companies have been rushing to develop technologies that help us track our physical health, mental health solutions were left far behind. That’s what we are changing with Kouo. Our technology gives the user insight into how their habits and activities affect them, helping them develop a deeper connection to their mental and physical wellbeing while meaningfully improving many other areas of their lives.

<br><br>

At Kouo we want to provide better access to preventive tools, encourage better engagement with mental health and open up a dialogue around protecting our wellbeing by looking at it holistically.

<br><br>

So when you share your NeuroPrint, beyond the beautiful picture also share a few words about the importance of mental wellbeing and emotional awareness and if it’s online tag us with #kouohealth.

Once again, thank you [Name], and don’t forget to watch this space for more.
